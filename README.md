I run Buttondown and Spoonbill. Before that, I spent four years at Stripe, where I did things like:

1. building data products into mature lines of business
2. managing reporting infrastructure & components used by hundreds of thousands of merchants
3. running and scaling Stripe's Product Quality initiative

I write and spend time mostly on my personal site, [arcana.computer](https://arcana.computer/).

That site is open source; you can view it [here](https://github.com/jmduke/arcana.computer).
