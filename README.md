Hello! I work at Stripe during the day and I run Buttondown and Spoonbill.

I write about the technology industry, with specific emphases on building and growing projects. 
I am also prone to a whole lot of navel-gazing, as you are probably soon to discover.

I write and spend time mostly on my personal site, [arcana.computer](https://arcana.computer/).

That site is open source; you can view it [here](https://github.com/jmduke/arcana.computer).
